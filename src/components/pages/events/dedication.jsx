				<p>
					In a landmark event held on December 11, 2023, the National
					Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK) showcased the
					culmination of groundbreaking technology with the dedication
					ceremony of the System for Emergency Assistance, Response,
					and Communication Hub (SEARCH) to the society. The event
					took place at the NITK campus in Surathkal and marked a
					significant leap in emergency response capabilities,
					particularly tailored for the coastal areas of Dakshina
					Kannada.
				</p>

				<p>
					SEARCH, anchored by its Control and Command Center within
					portable container cabins, integrates cutting-edge
					UHF/VHF/HF radio stations and autonomous aerial/marine
					vehicles. Born out of a transdisciplinary project led by the
					Centre for System Design (CSD) at NITK Surathkal, SEARCH
					redefines the landscape of emergency management.
				</p>

				<p>
					SEARCH stands out as a pioneering achievement globally. It
					seamlessly integrates autonomous marine vessels, aerial
					vehicles, and HAM radio stations within a single hub housed
					in portable containers. This groundbreaking integration
					showcases a revolutionary approach to disaster management,
					emergency response, and communication systems.

				<p>
					While designed for disaster response, SEARCH has broader
					applications, its scope has expanded to include a variety of
					applications such as monitoring water and air quality,
					observing patterns of coastal erosion and accretion, and
					assessing the health of mangroves. It also supplies vital
					coastal data to CRZ officials upon request. Furthermore,
					SEARCH serves as an educational hub for a diverse audience,
					including industry professionals, district administrators,
					academics, students, and HAM/Amateur radio enthusiasts.
				</p>

				<p>
					HAM Radio operations are being supported by Mangalore
					Amateur Radio Club (MARC) along with Manipal, highlighting
					the collaborative efforts of regional clubs in ensuring
					effective communication during emergencies.
				</p>

				<p>
					Dr. Pruthviraj U, the Project Head of SEARCH and Professor
					in Charge of Transdisciplinary R&D, played a pivotal role in
					the conceptualization and implementation of SEARCH. Other
					key faculty members, including Prof. K V Gangadharan, Dr.
					Mohit P Tahiliani, and Dr. Sreevalsa Kolathayar, contributed
					significantly to making SEARCH a true transdisciplinary
					project.
				</p>

				<p>
					NITK alumni, through their generous donations to SEARCH,
					demonstrate a commitment that transcends philanthropy. Their
					dedication reflects a deep sense of giving back to the
					institution that played a pivotal role in shaping their
					journeys. These contributions have been instrumental in
					making SEARCH a reality.
