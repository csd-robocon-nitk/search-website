				<p>
					The recent conclusion of the “Disaster Resilience through
					SEARCH (System for Emergency Assistance, Response and
					Communication Hub)” initiative marked a significant
					milestone in the field of disaster management. This
					collaborative effort by the Resilient Infrastructure
					Division (RID) of the National Institute of Disaster
					Management (NIDM) and the Centre for System Design at the
					National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK),
					Surathkal, provided participants with a wealth of insights
					and skills in cutting-edge disaster response technologies.

				<p>
					The program featured insightful sessions led by renowned
					experts in disaster management. These sessions covered a
					wide range of topics, including GIS applications,
					nature-based solutions in landslide mitigation, and the role
					of autonomous systems in disaster management.
				</p>

				<p>
					Participants were offered hands-on experiences in drone
					applications in medical aid, innovative engineering
					solutions for hazard mitigation, and hydraulics modelling
					for disaster resilience. These practical sessions allowed
					participants to apply their theoretical knowledge in
					real-world scenarios.
