                        The SEARCH facility is unlike any other in India. 
                        It employs not just sophisticated equipment for communication and surveillance, but also ensures ergonomic arrangements for the humans operating it. 
                        Dr. Pruthviraj U maintains the highest of standards in all his projects, and SEARCH is no exception.

                            My visit to SEARCH NITK wasn't just informative, it was eye-opening. 
                            Three ordinary shipping containers transformed into an extraordinary vision of resilience.
                            The communication hub pulsed with the urgency of real-time intel,
                            the "Dry Dock" brimmed with rescue tools ready to reach the 
                            unreachable, and the solo operator haven offered a beacon of
                            comfort in the midst of chaos. It was a powerful reminder
                            that ingenuity and technology can be harnessed for good, leaving
                            me deeply inspired and confident in the future of emergency response.

                        The visit to the SEARCH facility was enlightening. The state-of-the-art technology
                        and seamless connectivity showcased the vital role it plays in monitoring the sea
                        and surrounding area. Prof Prithiviraj further enhanced my understanding of the 
                        intricate network that enables our modern communication systems. Overall, a fascinating experience.

                        The visit to the SEARCH facility was a fascinating and educational 
                        experience. Despite spending over a year at NITK, I had limited knowledge
                        of this project. The advanced technology, particularly the communication
                        tower enabling us to intercept global frequency signals, intrigued me. 
                        The fact that that station has its very own operating call sign really 
                        makes me proud. If I hadn't been busy with academic and other club activities
                        I would really consider working on this project. It makes me wonder what 
                        new heights this project would reach in the upcoming years.

                            When I first saw the SEARCH facility, I was amazed that such a facility is 
                            there in NITK. It was fascinating to see shipping containers used in such 
                            a way. It was interesting to see the attention to detail when designing t
                            he living space, accommodating every need for someone living there 24/7. 
                            What fascinated me the most was that this facility could even communicate
                            with the international space station for a few seconds at a time. I feel
                            this is a significant step taken towards disaster management and could 
                            help save lives in the future.

                            It was a great experience to visit SEARCH lab, situated at the 
                            Arabian sea coast. The idea behind doing so was to get the most
                            out of sea water and coastal environment. The first sight of 
                            the Communication hub designed inside the container cabin and
                            the arrangement of elements immediately caught my eye. The 
                            design of the hex beam antenna, it's way of getting information
                            by reflecting signals from the ionosphere to communicate 
                            with countries across the globe was what I liked the most.
                            While Pruthviraj sir explained us about the idea, we could 
                            also see the different ships in the Arabian sea, parts of 
                            Suez canal and flights over NITK. I am lucky to have gained
                            some insights about this wonderful project.
